## Introduction

The world has experienced an explosion of openness. From individual artists
opening their creations for input from others, to governments requiring
publicly funded works be available to the public, both the spirit and practice
of sharing is gaining momentum and producing results.

Creative Commons began providing licenses for the open sharing of content only
a decade ago. Now more than 400 million CC-licensed works are available on the
Internet, from music and photos, to research findings and entire college
courses. Creative Commons created the legal and technical infrastructure that
allows effective sharing of knowledge, art and data by individuals,
organizations and governments. More importantly, millions of creators took
advantage of that infrastructure to share work that enriches the global commons
for all humanity.

*The Power of Open* collects the stories of those creators. Some are like
ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative news organization that uses
CC while partnering with the world’s largest media companies. Others like
nomadic filmmaker Vincent Moon use CC licensing as an essential element of a
lifestyle of openness in pursuit of creativity. The breadth of uses is as great
as the creativity of the individuals and organizations choosing to open their
content, art and ideas to the rest of the world.

As we look ahead, the field of openness is approaching a critical mass of
adoption that could result in sharing becoming a default standard for the many
works that were previously made available only under the all-rights-reserved
framework. Even more exciting is the potential increase in global welfare
from the use of Creative Commons’ tools and the increasing relevance of
openness to the discourse of culture, education and innovation policy.

We hope that *The Power of Open* inspires you to examine and embrace the
practice of open licensing so that your contributions to the global
intellectual commons can provide their greatest benefit to all people.
