# The Power of Open

## Introduction

The world has experienced an explosion of openness. From
individual artists opening their creations for input from others,
to governments requiring publicly funded works be available to
the public, both the spirit and practice of sharing is gaining
momentum and producing results.

Creative Commons began providing licenses for the open sharing of
content only a decade ago. Now more than 400 million CC-licensed
works are available on the Internet, from music and photos, to
research findings and entire college courses. Creative Commons
created the legal and technical infrastructure that allows
effective sharing of knowledge, art and data by individuals,
organizations and governments. More importantly, millions of
creators took advantage of that infrastructure to share work that
enriches the global commons for all humanity.

*The Power of Open* collects the stories of those
creators. Some are like ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning
investigative news organization that uses CC while partnering
with the world’s largest media companies. Others like nomadic
filmmaker Vincent Moon use CC licensing as an essential element
of a lifestyle of openness in pursuit of creativity. The breadth
of uses is as great as the creativity of the individuals and
organizations choosing to open their content, art and ideas to
the rest of the world.

As we look ahead, the field of openness is approaching a critical
mass of adoption that could result in sharing becoming a default
standard for the many works that were previously made available
only under the all-rights-reserved framework. Even more exciting
is the potential increase in global welfare from the use of
Creative Commons’ tools and the increasing relevance of openness
to the discourse of culture, education and innovation policy.

We hope that *The Power of Open* inspires you to examine and
embrace the practice of open licensing so that your contributions
to the global intellectual commons can provide their greatest
benefit to all people.
